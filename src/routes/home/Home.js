Concepts:

- Questionnaire

- A Questionnaire has a title and a description

- A questionnaire has a defined sequence of question that need to be answered

- Question

- 3 different types of questions are supported: Freetext, Multiple choice (single answer), Multiple

choice (multi answer)

- Questions can be flagged to have a mandatory answer

- Question has a description

- For Multiple Choice, each choice has a descriptive label that is shown to the user

Requirements:

- As a user when I start the questionnaire I see a view with title, description and a CTA to start

- As a user I can answers questions very swiftly so that I donâ€™t feel like I am wasting my time

- As a user I want the questionnaire to work dependable when I have bad network connectivity

- The questionnaire definition is based on a JSON structure that the frontend uses to drive the questions,

a good reference for a JSON might be here: http://docs.typeform.io/docs/introduction

- As a user I can go back to a previous question without losing the answers I have given in a current

question

- Mobile First, one of the pages contains an SVG, uses JS ES 6-7, naming convention for CSS
